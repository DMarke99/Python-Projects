Contains a python script which returns the polynomial (p(x)) of best fit to given data
Inputs:
y: the dependent variable (y = [p(x1),p(x2),...,p(xn)])
x: the independent variable (x = [x1,x2,...,xn])
n: the MAXIMUM degree of the polynomial (the highest possible exponent of x in the polynomial is n)
