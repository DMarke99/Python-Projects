# Sliding Tile Game Project

A fully scalable sliding tile puzzle coded in Python 3.6 using Pygame. Initially created because the implementation of the game in MATLAB allows for unsolvable puzzles to be generated.

## Prerequisites

To open and run the project on your computer you will need:

```
Python 3.6+
Pygame 1.9.3+
```

## Setup

1) Ensure you have the above dependencies installed.
2) Download the Sliding Tile Game folder
3) Execute by running SlidingTileGame.py

## Usage

Moves are made by clicking a tile adjacent to the blank tile. This slides the tile into the position of the blank tile

The game is won when the tiles are lined in ascending order going right, then down, with the blank tile in the bottom-right corner

## Contributers

This project was created entirely by myself in a day in January. The greatest challenge was figuring out how best to implement the game mechanisms and renderer.
